2ed1e6e	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 10 11:49:51 2015	Working on improving the imports so PyInstaller works. There seem to be a lot of import related errors, especially with Pandas and matplotlib.
cd41c4c	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 10 09:43:45 2015	Fixed missing key bugs in the SplashScreen method as well.
850599e	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 10 09:40:23 2015	Finally figured out how to write the closing loop properly.
b18fcfa	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 10 09:31:28 2015	Fixed an issue with the older getDescriptionTypes and getSources methods that I removed yesterday so that I can use the category tree instead.
c9b0217	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 9 17:55:47 2015	Working on UserManager.
d199cce	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 9 16:48:32 2015	Got the kinks in the managermapping portion fixed. Now I need to focus on the actual employees form. I need to map changes, removal and addition. I also need to map the workcalendar initializer to a thread, though I've done this for all current employees already till 2030.
c94a8ab	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 9 15:08:36 2015	Working on the managermapping bit.
7ccb63f	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 9 15:04:58 2015	Working on the managermapping bit.

c99bfd6	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Nov 5 13:18:34 2015	Working on the UserManager class definition.
709a10f	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Nov 4 16:55:17 2015	DailyPorker works fine now, but graphs are disabled for now. I'll focus on the DBR and WBR next.
9e1b107	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Nov 4 12:23:14 2015	Added new icons for Vindaloo, and mapped them to the code, replacing QPushButtons with ImageButtons.
4edc9c2	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Nov 4 10:42:19 2015	Changed the getWritersList and getEmployeesList methods in Moses to use Pandas now. getWritersList takes Promotions into accounts quite well now.
e558a49	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 3 15:22:33 2015	Cleaning up DailyPorker.
de3d930	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 3 14:43:27 2015	Got registron to work well.
1f2032c	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 3 14:15:16 2015	Added a few new quotes.

41ad7bf	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 3 09:23:14 2015	Fixed a bug w.r.t SMEs in OINKUIMethods.
ee6b906	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Nov 3 08:46:48 2015	Working on BACON UI.
933b7c6	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 17:38:49 2015	Added category tree icons, and mapped buttons to open the category tree viewer in Vindaloo.
64565ed	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 16:39:49 2015	Changing Vindaloo UI. Removed the horrendous colors, using a sleeker UI now. Mapped TNA and Calculator to the tool, and reduced time in opening PiggyBankWithFilter by adding the categorytree to the list of startup arguments.
2bfe70b	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 16:08:49 2015	Added a mouseover for the alert button, and cleaned up the calculator icons. Also added mouseover icons for the buttons in Vindaloo, and fixed the error with the leaves button.
97af348	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 16:00:18 2015	Added a status line to PiggyBankWithFilter and improved messages and pokeyoke for buttons.
6cc1a97	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 13:32:46 2015	I'd forgotten to call the super keypressevent in CopiableQTableWidget, so I've mapped it now. That fixes the keypress issue.
3233190	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 13:26:43 2015	Created a DescriptionTypesFilter class. I can reuse this to select types easily.
e61ba59	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 12:49:34 2015	Completed the final touches on the PiggyBankWithFilter class. I need to separate the audit planner from it, so that it doesn't come in the way.
784a3f8	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 10:59:52 2015	Improved the CopiableQTableWidget class so that it has an inbuilt dataframe support. Also working on getting the summarizer to work.
0c330e7	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 10:44:55 2015	Trying to add the eye.
57672cd	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 10:03:56 2015	Working on getPiggyBankWithFilters method. Trying to build a dataframe in an order this time.
f0934a3	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 09:07:21 2015	Created the CopiableQTableWidget class that lets me create tables that I can easily copy from without worrying about tab management.
2c47d4d	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Nov 2 08:56:00 2015	Improving the PiggyBankWithFilters class for easier data extraction and summarization.
abd89ad	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 18:00:03 2015	Added three icons, to paint on the TNAViewer canvas so that the verdict is clearer. That way, a writer will also be able to make sense of the data. Also, added a way to use minimum acceptable values or the maximum score for parameters from the scoring table. So that way, the true deviation can be comprehended easily.
b2c938c	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 16:48:15 2015	Made some minor adjustments to the UI of filterform, shifted the label QLineEdit there so it's easier. Also added more informative aboutMessages so that users understand why the data doesn't load when it doesn't.
e66303f	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 14:33:44 2015	Trying formatting the graphs, and linking the process to save and post to the ImageLabel.
452e3b0	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 14:30:03 2015	Trying formatting the graphs, and linking the process to save and post to the ImageLabel.
9ae6daa	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 14:22:04 2015	Trying formatting the graphs, and linking the process to save and post to the ImageLabel.
2338b42	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 14:20:29 2015	Trying formatting the graphs, and linking the process to save and post to the ImageLabel.
a5d1ef8	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 30 14:02:34 2015	got graphs to work. Need to format them.
8a5b82b	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Oct 29 14:49:02 2015	Created a data table. Also fixed a bug with how deviations are calculated. The plotting is pending.
38b997d	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Oct 29 13:06:05 2015	Mapped all the filters to the TNA. Working on graphs now. Pareto first.
0b3dfda	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 28 17:47:35 2015	Added controls for enabling and disabling the TNAViewer plotting button.
7ce9c35	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 28 17:29:15 2015	Got the category filters to pass to the Moses method as well. I get the appropriate audit count as well now. All that's pending is the actual plotting and summarizing.
62cb574	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 28 16:00:38 2015	Made major UI improvements to the TNA Viewer. QGridLayout doesn't help much whenever I use it. I should stop using it.
d31eee8	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 28 10:23:57 2015	Added mouseovericon support to ImageButton, and created Mouseover icons for all the buttons in PORK.
75f959e	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Oct 27 13:24:48 2015	Got the filter buttons to work, mapped them to each other. Now I'm working on the parameter filters. Next, I'll write methods to pull gseo and cfm only for selected filters.
33c0899	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Oct 27 11:32:48 2015	Fixed year typo.
3a70591	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 22:46:43 2015	Added mousemove events and mapped the Eye to the movements. Works quite well. I can add other eyes later. I haven't added the blinking yet.
8c7fc93	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 21:47:06 2015	Added new Icons, picked by Varun. Also added Fatal notification in the calendar.
c419f28	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 15:30:02 2015	Adding icons to WeekCalendar. I can draw pixmaps on any date now. Works like a charm.
01bd3fc	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 13:02:32 2015	Calibrated the progressbar for statstable calculation.
d07fcef	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 12:27:20 2015	Made some more changes, mostly bug fixes in the previous commit. Speed seems greatly improved.
386d3a8	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 11:23:01 2015	Merged the getCFM and getGSEO methods into getCFMGSEO. Makes more sense since anyone pulls both up together. Plus, it saves a lot of overhead.
09a934a	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 11:02:26 2015	Integrated the new getTargetFor method into the getEfficiencyFor methods across Moses, and integrated the category tree into the Porker thread. I need to merge the CFM and GSEO methods now to save time.
80e255e	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 23 10:26:04 2015	Rewrote the getTargetFor function. Since PORK already loads the category tree, it only makes sense to use that dataframe to extract targets. This function works quite well, and the speed is far better. I should replace the old method in Porker to use this.
5cbd83e	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 21 13:46:47 2015	Meddling with FilterForm layout.
7125310	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 21 12:36:41 2015	Shifted modules to separate files: CategorySelector and FilterForm.
e2be091	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 21 10:51:53 2015	Added a method to the CategoryFilter class to get the selected verticals, based on what has been selected. I need to code an interlock between the filter boxes so that if, say, a BU is unchecked, its dependent supercategories and so on are unchecked as well.
b0f0fa6	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 21 09:52:14 2015	Improved responsiveness of the category filter.
375fd3d	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 21 09:27:58 2015	Got the CategoryFilter class to work. It seems a little sluggish, but that'll suffice for now.
bd3adef	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Oct 20 16:38:34 2015	Improved the CheckableComboBox to emit a signal when the selection is changed.
ba42f9b	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Oct 20 16:14:53 2015	Added GSEO and CFM markers on the calendar.
d6515df	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Oct 19 17:37:36 2015	Working on the TNAViewer.
73b6305	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Oct 19 09:44:51 2015	Wrote the TNAViewer class. Created placeholders for all UI functions. I need to plan out the way this is going to work next.
94eeb24	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 16 13:19:15 2015	Changed the Big Brother icon to a button. Clicking it plays the 8bit TMNT song.
c1e5fad	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 16 13:18:23 2015	Changed the Big Brother icon to a button. Clicking it plays the 8bit TMNT song.
4a261a0	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 16 11:44:52 2015	Added some logos, and an about button. Cleaned up major parts of the UI, and it seems pretty neat right now. I'll start work on the TNA module next.
37bf7b9	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Oct 16 09:24:54 2015	Reduced the size of the CategoryFinder widget by making the result table popup instead. Much cleaner this way, plus saves space.
15c8476	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Oct 15 17:02:53 2015	Making UI improvements, plus added category finder event mapping.
a51f275	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Oct 15 11:02:29 2015	Changed the efficiency widget in each calculatorRow to a DoubleSpinBox, so if writers want to plan their efficiency without knowing how many they need to write to make a certain efficiency, this will tell them that. The event is mapped to the editFinished event of the doublespinbox.
c168b1a	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Oct 15 09:15:31 2015	Fixed a bug with the new addCalc functionality so it adds a new row to the top of the table.
cebb876	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 14 17:52:18 2015	Got a use button to work, also figured out how to pass arguments to a connector in pyqt using functools.partial. That's a nifty module.
0760e56	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 14 17:36:41 2015	Pushed the finder to a new class, CategoryFinder.
3b094d9	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 14 17:27:34 2015	Shifted the Any option in the finder combobox so that it's the default option.
b02d7cf	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 14 17:26:49 2015	Users can find a vertical in the efficiency calculator now. I need to modify this so that the finder widget is an external class, so I can incorporate this into different areas of OINK. Also, I need to provide a 'use' button in each row of the search results, which emits a dictionary with that combination when used.
9390a81	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 14 14:20:59 2015	Improved the UI and behaviour of the Efficiency Calculator, and I've added icons to OINK and Vindaloo. Vindaloo's icons aren't mapped to anything yet, but the efficiency calculator is smoother now. I'm going to add a way to find a vertical as well.
ce668ae	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Oct 13 16:11:21 2015	Working on an improved efficiency calculator.
e61a9ce	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Oct 12 13:00:04 2015	Regular commit for data.
711ee48	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 7 10:01:03 2015	Reimplemented the modification\addition pokeyoke in Pork. This version won't compile in Pyinstaller because there's a problem with oauth2 and oauth2client (for Sty Cleaner to work), the module I need to get Vindaloo to work. To do so, one needs to temporarily disable Vindaloo in OINK.
e5a2877	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Oct 7 09:24:57 2015	There's some strange bug with the efficiency formula. It's also counting dates on which the team is on leave. FK holidays, basically.
b6871d2	Vinay Keerthi	Sun Sep 27 15:48:19 2015	Working on slight improvements to some long pending bugs.
c3be0ee	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Sep 25 19:56:16 2015	Making minor improvements to LogInDialog.
e993596	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Sep 24 16:54:38 2015	Fixed the host id editing problem (finally).
695d9dd	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Sep 11 12:51:21 2015	Added new raw data file.
011cf70	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Sep 1 10:15:40 2015	Changed an instance of QProgressBar to use my own ProgressBar class. Also tweaked the DailyGraphView UI to improve alignment, and drew borders around the images. In addition, I've also set the default date for DailyPorker and PiggyBankWithFilter to the last working date, as it makes more sense that one would want to derive that report on a given date rather than today's.
b95e9d7	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Aug 31 11:12:01 2015	There's a bug in the way PiggyBankWithFilter gets the audit plan. It should compare the last few wordcounts, and figure out if it's stuck in an infinite loop. Right now, I've maxed out the loop at 1000x. Beyond it, it'll just assume audit conditions are satisfied and we can break out.
12e4834	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Aug 31 09:33:01 2015	Removed some print statements related to the calendar.
a65fd33	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Aug 25 18:47:48 2015	Test commit. Something's wrong with the work network and github isn't reachable via push or pull.
e1d874e	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Aug 21 17:47:54 2015	Added new targets. Need to improve how efficiency is calculated.
448abaf	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Aug 17 13:51:41 2015	Regular commit.
789c1d0	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Aug 12 14:00:52 2015	Regular commit.
82d0edb	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Aug 4 12:26:17 2015	Improved MOSES.getLastWorkingDate. It can now accept an All value for the queryUser variable, which makes it return the last working date for the entire team instead. I've also fixed a minor problem with the queryDate type. If a datetime.datetime is passed, the code strips it to a datetime.date value. Also working on the Bacon backend, which is how I noticed this fix.
007cb11	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Jul 27 08:42:21 2015	Finished work on SwineHerd. Cleaned some code up, and deleted the old Swine module. I've also removed the imports to Swine from PORK. Plus, I've managed to fix the leave planner issue, it was an issue with case sensitivity at the accept() stage during the form submission. Anyway, that's been fixed now. I need to distribute this to the writers.
081e6e9	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Jul 24 12:47:51 2015	Finished working on Swine, it now extracts images and information from the FK site.
8214a73	Vinay Keerthi	Sat Jul 18 11:58:42 2015	Added a link to the github.io page in readme.
303b4ab	Vinay Keerthi	Sat Jul 18 11:58:05 2015	Added a link to the github.io page in readme.
dedd5f8	Vinay Keerthi	Sat Jul 18 11:56:18 2015	Improved the audit planning module in PiggyBankWithFilter. Fixed some bugs with the equal-targets-for-editors mode, and also wrote code to pull random fsns as required by the audit plan. Made some minor UI improvements, added tool tips and checked the code with the actual data. There's some minor issue, but it's related to the process, not the code at hand. I need to cross check with Manjeet.
f34d9eb	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Jul 17 22:52:43 2015	Improved the renameHost.py module. It needs psutil now, and it can start\stop my local MySQL server now depending on requirement.
38f5025	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Jul 16 14:24:39 2015	Fixed bug with PiggyBankWithFilter where the app doesn't work when opened without the console.
565ab7b	Vinay Keerthi	Thu Jul 16 09:16:46 2015	Improved PiggyBankWithFilter's resetEditorConstraints method. Now, it can even plan work load for over any period of time. However, it still doesn't take editors' personal leaves into account. Will do so later. Also, I've put alert messages after each step and set the difference between min and max word count spinboxes to 1000.
8d42a60	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 15 14:21:32 2015	Working on PiggyBankWithFilter. Waiting for approval from Manjeet on the code.
059e91f	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 15 12:56:25 2015	PiggyBankWithFilter is going to serve as the platform for Bacon now. Working on the audit planner, pulling numbers based on preset constraints. It's almost done, there are some problems with how it balances the work and audit percentages. I think it'll get fixed if I clean up the code a little. I might have to scrap the summarize() method and rewrite it. That can easily fix it.
3560fe2	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Jul 13 14:26:20 2015	Fixed a bug with Seeker, infinite loop even after fetching all data. Also working on PiggyBankWithFilter, got the writers' names to dynamically filter. Just need to build the report string now.
70b0346	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Jul 13 14:20:51 2015	Fixed a bug with Seeker, infinite loop even after fetching all data. Also working on PiggyBankWithFilter, got the writers' names to dynamically filter. Just need to build the report string now.
6a91821	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Jul 10 13:07:01 2015	Working on the PiggyBankWithFilters class. Still have to connect the filter boxes to each other. I've also fixed some bugs with the CheckableComboBox class definition, but there's a bigger bug which triggers when the first item, the title item, is clicked. I need to fix that. I've also improved some UI bits of Vindaloo as well as changed the window theme mode to plastique.
1622103	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jul 7 16:46:27 2015	Finished FarmHand, the feedback collation tool and implemented it in Vindaloo.
08f1496	Vinay Keerthi	Fri Jul 3 13:20:09 2015	Daily commit.
52019b2	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 1 10:59:20 2015	Fixed error with the previous KRA fix. Checks that an efficiency value is not a string, since CFM and GSEO were numpy.float64 values instead of python floats.
b694a7b	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 1 08:55:32 2015	Little clean up.
0f58952	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 1 08:53:44 2015	Little clean up.
f39d841	vinay87	Wed Jul 1 08:52:12 2015	Merge pull request #7 from smchaha/patch-1
45db784	Vinay Keerthi	Wed Jul 1 08:45:50 2015	Added auto sort to DailyPorker. Improved the string formatting to show leading zeroes so that the PyQt QTablewidget's sort works. It's strange, I need to find some better way to do it. Perhaps subclass QTableWidget? Later. Also disabled some widgets to prevent confusion at user end in dailyPorker. There were also some bugs related to KRA calculations. I've fixed that too now. It's related to how it tries to calculate KRA for a '-' value. Adding these to Github's issue repo.
ce91712	smchaha	Wed Jul 1 01:56:55 2015	Correcting README.md
037957a	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 21:29:20 2015	Fixed error in DailyPorker code. Shows '-' for leaves now.
eb1e5fe	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 21:28:40 2015	Fixed error in DailyPorker code. Shows '-' for leaves now.
ed04dc9	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 21:12:52 2015	Working on a PiggyBank viewer with several filter options. Created a CheckableComboBoxClass that solves my checkboxlist problems.
7ee85b2	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 16:30:25 2015	Finished the Daily Porker Tool. Add more features later.
9ff1def	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 16:03:33 2015	DailyPorker is almost ready. I've hidden the audit percentage option for now. Possible bugs with Daily KRA when the efficiency or quality is NaN or '-'. I'll fix it later.
215e41b	Vinay Keerthi	Tue Jun 30 14:49:03 2015	DailyPorker is almost ready. Finished integrating the graphs, but the graphinator function needs to be  incorporated in a thread. Weirdly, PyQt says that the graphing function needs to be in the foreground thread, not in a backend thread. Next, I need to enable the filesavedialogs for the report and for the graphs. Also, I need to write functions to get KRA for given date range.
afffd53	Vinay Keerthi	Mon Jun 29 22:54:12 2015	Working on additional features for the DailyPorker VINDALOO tool. UI facets are almost done. The back end needs to be coded now. That includes new MOSES methods for calculating KRAs and team statistics.
